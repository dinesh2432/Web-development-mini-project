        <h3>
            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (1931–2015), widely known as the "Missile Man of India," was a distinguished scientist, visionary leader, and the 11th President of India. Born into a modest family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam’s early life was marked by perseverance and curiosity. Despite financial hardships, he excelled academically and pursued aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. Kalam made significant contributions to India’s defense and space programs during his tenure at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was instrumental in the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and ballistic missiles like Agni and Prithvi, earning him the title "Missile Man." He also played a crucial role in India’s nuclear tests at Pokhran in 1998, cementing India’s position as a nuclear power. Elected as India’s President in 2002, Kalam was a unifying figure, loved for his humility and vision for a developed India. He inspired millions, especially the youth, through his books, lectures, and interactions. A recipient of the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honor, Kalam remains an enduring symbol of knowledge, integrity, and innovation, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire generations.
